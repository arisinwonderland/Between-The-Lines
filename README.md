# Between The Lines

A game in the Unity engine about getting home. Your friends and family are gone, and your reality is fractured. Stranded in between two parallel dimensions that don't quite match up with the world as you know it, with only a plot device and your own two hands, you navigate your way through a lot of puzzles in a place that we haven't figured out the details of yet.
